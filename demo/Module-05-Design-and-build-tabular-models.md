# Module 5: Design and build tabular models

## Create Power BI model relationships [[learn module]](https://learn.microsoft.com/training/modules/create-power-bi-model-relationships)

- Create a model with 2 tables without a relationship (product-sales) and create a chart. Fix the wrong aggregated values by introducting a relationship
- Create an inactive relationships (eg on shipdate) and use it in a DAX expression
- Demonstrate DAX filter context and use CALCULATE() to overide a filter
- Setup a date table using CALENDAR() and CALENDARAUTO()
- Use TOTALYTD() to summarize over time
- Use PREVIOUSQUARTER() to compare over time

## Use DAX time intelligence functions in Power BI Desktop models [[learn module]](https://learn.microsoft.com/training/modules/dax-power-bi-time-intelligence)

## Create calculation groups [[learn module]](https://learn.microsoft.com/training/modules/create-calculation-groups)

- Create a calculation group using Tabular Editor

## Enforce Power BI model security [[learn module]](https://learn.microsoft.com/training/modules/enforce-power-bi-model-security)

- Setup and test row level security (static and dynamic)
- Setup OLS rules to a Power BI Desktop model by using anÂ XML for Analysis (XMLA) endpoint

## Use tools to optimize Power BI performance [[learn module]](https://learn.microsoft.com/training/modules/use-tools-optimize-power-bi-performance)

- Show performance studio, while connected to a direct query model
- Show DAX Studio and look for some model metrics
- Use the Best practices analyzer
